Explanation and Guidance
Indentation Issue:

The return statement is not indented properly. In Python, indentation is critical as it defines code blocks. Lack of indentation here will cause an IndentationError.

Skill prerequisite: Understand Python's indentation rules and code block structure.

TypeError in Function Call:

The function is called with arguments 5 (an integer) and '10' (a string). Python cannot add an integer and a string directly, causing a TypeError.

Conceptual understanding: Data types and type compatibility are crucial. Adding mismatched types causes runtime errors.

Guiding Questions:

Are all parts of your function body properly indented according to Python syntax?

What types of variables are being passed to your function? Could automatic conversion or type checks help?

How might you verify types or safely convert inputs before performing operations?

Debugging Strategies:

Add print() statements before the return to check the input values and types.

Carefully read the error messages Python providesâ€”they often indicate the cause and line number of the problem.

Use a debugger (like pdb) to step through the function and inspect variables.

Example Hint Without Fixing:

Imagine you want to add the number 5 and the text "10" together. What operation would work if you treat both as numbers? Or if both are strings?

Think about using functions like int() or str() to handle type conversions, but consider when each is appropriate.
